2	Python review (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
3	Forward and backward propagation
4	Loss functions, optimization (SGD, Adam)
5	Implementing a neural net from scratch (NumPy only)
6	Intro to PyTorch/Keras: tensors, gradients
7	Build and train simple MLP on MNIST (PyTorch & Keras)
8	Overfitting/Underfitting, regularization, dropout
9	Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
10	Mini-project: Compare MLPs on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST
11	Learning rate schedules, weight initialization
12	Review, write blog-style summary of learnings
